# Basic Statments Preparation

### Exercise 1. Number Guessing Game
#### Goal
In the `number_guessing_game` module, create a program where the computer picks a random number between 1 and 50, and the user tries to guess it.

##### Requirements

- The game should tell the user if their guess is too high or too low.
- Keep track of how many attempts the user makes.
- When the user guesses correctly, display a congratulatory message and the number of attempts.
- The game should continue until the user guesses the correct number.

##### Bonus (Optional)

- Handle invalid input (e.g., if the user types text instead of a number).
- Let the user play again after finishing.
- Show all their previous guesses at the end.

### Exercise 2: Simple Calculator
#### Goal

Complete the starter code in `calculator.py` to build a simple calculator.

##### Requirements
- Implement multiplication, and division manually
- Use `python3 -m unittest tests/test_calculator.py` to run tests for this exercise.

##### Bonus

- Handle invalid input or operations.
- Add extra operations like power or modulus (Implement manually)
